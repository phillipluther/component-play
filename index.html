            I checked out web components _waaaay_ back when they were first getting buzz. Then I got
            discouraged by all those "Broken Promise of Web Components" blog posts. Now that Edge is
            gonna Chromium up (and be available on legacy Windows systems!), I'm taking a second
            look at 'em as a viable/compatible tech moving forward.

            I know it makes me a horrible person, but I've thrown a lot of due-diligence out the
            window with this repo - accessibility considerations, decent design, DRY principles. I'm
            mostly concerned with seeing how web components work.
