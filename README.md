Goofballin' around with web components

I checked out web components _waaaay_ back when they were first getting buzz. Then I got discouraged by all those "Broken Promise of Web Components" blog posts.

Now that Edge is gonna Chromium up (and be available on legacy Windows systems!), I'm taking a second look at 'em as a viable/compatible tech moving forward.

I'm essentially following along with [this tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components#Tutorials) from MDN and [this tutorial](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/customelements) from Google Developers.
