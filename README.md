Goofballin' around with web components

I checked out web components _waaaay_ back when they were first getting buzz. Then I got discouraged by all those "Broken Promise of Web Components" blog posts.

Now that Edge is gonna Chromium up (and be available on legacy Windows systems!), I'm taking a second look at 'em as a viable/compatible tech moving forward.

[Demos are here](https://phillipluther.github.io/component-play/examples).

## Constant WIP

This is a bit of a sandbox repo; it'll violently change from commit-to-commit.
